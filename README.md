# Overview

`HashHistogram` creates histograms with keys of any hashable data type. Features include:

* Check histogram count for a key.
* Check total histogram counts across all keys.
* Provide all keys in descending ranked order.
* Find the mode of the histogram (i.e., an item with the largest number of counts)
* Find the mode of any `IntoIterator` type, bulding a `HashHistogram` as an intermediate step.

# Updates
* **0.7.0**: `HashHistogram` and `KeyType` now implement `Default`.
* **0.6.2**: Fixed serious bug in `bump_by()`.
* **0.6.1**: Added `bump_by()`.
* **0.6.0**: Refactored `mode()` and `mode_values()` so that they only return the mode, rather than both mode and count.
* **0.5.2**: Added `mode_values()`
* **0.5.1**: Fixed some documentation.
* **0.5**: Initial public release.
